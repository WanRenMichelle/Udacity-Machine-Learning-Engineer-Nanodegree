# Replay Buffer
# Most modern reinforcement learning algorithms benefit from using a replay memory or buffer to store and recall experience tuples.
# Here is a sample implementation of a replay buffer that you can use:
import random
from collections import namedtuple, deque

            batch_size: size of each training batch
        """
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=buffer_size)  # internal memory (deque)
